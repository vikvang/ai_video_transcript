Icon Requirements for Chrome Extension:

Place the following icon files in this directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons will be used for the extension's toolbar icon, Chrome Web Store listing, and other Chrome extension UI elements.

You can use any image editing software to create these icons, or use online tools like:
- https://www.canva.com/
- https://www.figma.com/

For a professional look, consider using a simple, recognizable design that works well at small sizes.
